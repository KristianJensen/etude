    "in this small course we will teach you the basics of how to work with metabolic models in all shapes and sizes. We want to show you how easy it is ~using modern tools and packages~ to come up with design strategies for microbial production strains of the future. When we say easy we mean: \"Look at me, I only needed these 100 odd lines of code to produce cumaric acid from methanol\" not \"Mwahaha, I just stole that baby's lolly\". Although, with some practice you may find both actions equally easy, regardless of how heinous they may seem to others.\n",
